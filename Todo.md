##Things to implement and ideas

* File list in the ShareDetailsActivity
* Enable sharing of text and display it accordingly on the webinterface
* Therefore improve the web interface with some nice javascript
* Add more Interfaces to allow dynamic changes to the behavior of the app
* Use sqlite for the database (but keep the old one; DAO Interface!)
* Add Settings menu that allows setting a master password amongst other things
* the master password should grant access to all shares via the webinterface
* handle race conditions, when binding a service
* add different share modes (e.g. bluetooth, nfc(?), internet(?))
